# Basic Score Counter Project

This basic score counter program was done in an attempt to match the project: *Score Keeper CodeAlong* in the Udemy course *The Web Developer Bootcamp* by Colt Steele as closely as possible without viewing any of the actual code.
I did this project in an attempt to gain a better understanding of DOM and how to better use Javascript in conjunction with HTML and CSS. Some of the specific things I worked on include:

- DOM manipulation through the selection of Id and class as well as the changing of text
- Higher complexity event handling by both adding and removing event listeners
- Javascript specific state and variable management
- Class manipulation

While this project is definitely basic and the functionality is limited, it was a great way for me to brush up on HTML and CSS as well as gain a deeper understanding of Javascript.
